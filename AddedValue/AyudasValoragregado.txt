The equations in this program are like the next example:

Normal function=
cos(x^2)+ sqrt(x^3)

Program syntax=
cos(x**2)+math.sqrt(x**3)

These expressions are the most common:

Expression ----- program expression
exp	       -----         	e
seno       -----         sin
coseno     -----         cos
^	         -----         **
square root-----         mat.sqrt()
ln         -----         log

If you need other expression you can visit the following link:

If you want to execute newton method, you put the function f(x), the derivate of this function (f'(x)), X0 which is a initial value, a tolerance (tol) and a maximum of iterations (max iters).

For example:

f(x)= x+2
f'(x)=1
X0=-3
Tol= 0.0001 (with dot)
Max iters = 100

If you want to execute bisection or secant method, you put the function f(x), X0 which is a initial value, X1 that is other initial value, a tolerance (tol) and a maximum of iterations (max iters).

Where [x0,x1] interval should be the root.

For example:

f(x)= x+2
X0=-3
X1=1
Tol= 0.0001 (with dot)
Max iters = 100

If you want to execute fixed point method, you put the function f(x), g(x) that is another function, X0 which is a initial value,  a tolerance (tol) and a maximum of iterations (max iters).

For example:

f(x)= x+2
g(x)= x**2
X0=-3
Tol= 0.0001 (with dot)
Max iters = 100

If you want to execute multiple roots method, you put the function f(x), the derivate of this function (f'(x)), the second derivate of this function f''(x), X0 which is a initial value, a tolerance (tol) and a maximum of iterations (max iters).

For example:

f(x)= x**2+2
f'(x)=2x
f''(x)= 2
X0=-3
Tol= 0.0001 (with dot)
Max iters = 100
