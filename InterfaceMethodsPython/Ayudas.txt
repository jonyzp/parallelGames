If you are in this section is because you need help.

You can generate random dominant diagonal matrix with the button generate matrix and you need to put the order of the matrix.
But you can create a file called matrix.txt and the same folder when files .py are.

The shape of the matrix is like the following example:

5
8 2 1 2 1 28
2 8 2 1 1 33
2 1 8 1 2 42
2 1 2 9 2 56
2 1 2 2 9 63

Where, the first line is the order and the others are the matrix Ab.

If you want to execute Jacobi or Seidel method you need to put a tolerance, maximum of iterations and the initial values.

For example: Tolerance = 0.0001 (With dot), max interations= 1000 and initial values = [1,2,3,4] the size of this array is the same that the order of the matrix, separates with comma and whit '[',']'.

If you want to execute Relaxed Jacobi or Seidel method you need to put a tolerance, maximum of iterations, the initial values and a lambda.

For example: Tolerance = 0.0001 (With dot), max interations= 1000, initial values = [1,2,3,4] the size of this array is the same that the order of the matrix, separates with comma and whit '[',']' and a lambda = 0.25 (with dot).

If you want to execute LU, LU with Cholesky, LU with Crout, LU with DooLittle, LU with Gauss, Gauss with partial or total pivoting or simple Gaussian elimination, you only need to press the button where is the name of the method.
